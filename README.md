### ***Goals and Potential Ideas ***

***
My goal with this capstone will be to utulize a complex set of models to create a very engaging and delightful user experience. I want to understand the relationships between message interaction since it is so prevelant in today's world, so that I can be better prepared for what's out there. My full CRUD will give users the ability to create, update, find new users and delete (or disable!) their own accounts in addition to creating, deleting, and updating their own resume of people they add to the conversations they make! Upon "liking" another user, that will be stored in the database, and if there is a *match*, logic will be setup that creates new conversations, and true connections can take place. If I get all of those goals set up in a reasonable time frame, I have even more ideas I want to implement to make the website more customized, more accessible, more responsive, and just more enjoyable to be involved in! See details below

*Priority Objectives:*

- [] ERD Diagram for list of organizational hierchy of project
- [] Full CRUD and MVP
- [] Conditional put requests (and posts for matching!) for liking and unliking users
- [] User authentication
- [] Conditional rendering for users based off gender chosen
- [] Proper associations and understanding between models to avoid many conflicts
- [] Professional styling, responsive UI, animation effects 
- [] Slide show capabilities not only for styling but for presenting questions in the questions model
- [] Using questions to personalize characteristics of users and giving them more reason to enjoy the community of the site as a whole
- [] Deploying my project

*Potential Ideas:*

- [] Third Party API for locations, pick up lines, questions, or small things I can think of to avoid seeeding many things
- [] Global Chat implementation using websockets
- [] Filtering methods for fiding people with specific characteristics
- [] Blocking or unmatching capabilities that will delete conversations between users
- [] Conditional styling based on characteristics of users
- [] More ideas to come soon!
